# Analytica-Portfolio
Data Analytics Portfolio

I am a data analyst with a background in business administration and experience across the retail, fashion apparel, and insurance industries. I enjoy drawing data from different sources, organizing it, and turning it into insights that drive impact — from improving decision-making and identifying opportunities to enhancing customer experience and supporting business growth.

Having lived and worked in multiple countries, and speaking several languages, I bring a global perspective and the ability to bridge cultural barriers. This helps me not only analyze data, but also interpret it in context and communicate insights effectively across diverse teams and markets. At VF Corporation and Pentland Brands, I worked within the EMEA market managing customer relationships, where I saw firsthand how aligning data with strategy leads to stronger results.

Currently completing the Data Analytics Career Accelerator program with the London School of Economics (LSE), I am on track for distinction. Through this program, I’ve gained advanced skills in SQL, Python, and data visualization, alongside practical frameworks for approaching problems with a data-driven mindset.

I am curious by nature and passionate about connecting people, systems, and insights. My goal is to help organizations turn complex data into clear stories and actionable strategies, combining analytical expertise with hands-on experience in business, marketing, operations, and finance.
